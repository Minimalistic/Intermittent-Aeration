# Intermittent-Aeration
 A small project experimenting with DWC Hydroponics run intermittently

This project primarily exists as a learning exercise in electronics, soldering, working with batteries and solar panels etc.  

## Notes

Currently power usage is unnecessarily inefficient, there is no sleep sleep mode, just the trinket sitting there the majority of the time counting until the next time it gets to cycle the pump.
